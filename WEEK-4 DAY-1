QUESTION 1

Jeevan has been given a task by his Java professor Mrs. Shruti to create an enum of the subjects which he is studying in current semester. 
It is also instructed that there must be 2 attributes of each Subject i.e. Faculty Name and credits(int) of the subject. Details of the subjects are:

**Subject, Credits, Faculty Name **
Java, 4, Shruti OS, 3, Puneet Kumar AI, 2, James William Android, 3, Md. Adil Khan
Jethalal is supposed to write a main class in which the name of subject is taken as input and the faculty name and credits of that subject should be displayed using switch statement. If the input given is not matching with the listed subjects, display This subject is not running in this semester.

Input Format--->>>First line of the input reads the subject name

Constraints-->>NA

Output Format--->>>Prints the name of the Faculty and credits seperated by SPACE.
Prints This subject is not running in this semester. if input does not match with the subjects of enum.

                break;
            default:
                System.out.println("This subject is not running in this semester.");
                return;
        }

        System.out.println(facultyName + " " + credits);
    }
}

QUESTION----2


Suppose that you want to write a program to calculate the marks of a student of all his subjects that he has learnt in a particular semester. 
Take the input from the user which will ask him to enter no. of subjects he has learnt. If the input given is greater than 0, then program should 
ask the user to enter the marks of each subject. After entering all the marks, calculate and print total marks scored by him in all subjects. 
If the input given is negative or zero, then display the message “Invalid”.

Input Format--->>The first input line should ask the user to enter no. of subjects he has learnt. The remaining input lines should ask the user to 
enter the marks scored by him in each subject.

Constraints--->>Number of subjects should be greater than 0. i.e. 1 ≤ n ≤ 10 If any subject marks entered by him is negative value or greater than 100, 
then it should not be considered. i.e. 0 ≤ marks ≤ 100

Output Format--->Sum of marks of all subjects entered by user.

public class Solution {
    public static void main(String[] args)

        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

        if (numSubjects <= 0) {
            System.out.println("Invalid");
            return;
        }

        int totalMarks = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i <= numSubjects; i++) {
            int marks = sc.nextInt();
            if (marks >= 0 && marks <= 100) {
                totalMarks += marks;
            }
        }

        System.out.println(totalMarks);
    }
}
