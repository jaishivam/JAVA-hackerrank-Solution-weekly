        String s=sc.nextLine();
        s=s.toLowerCase();
        s=s.trim();
        for(int i=0;i<s.length();i++)
        {
            if(s.charAt(i)!=' ')
                System.out.print(s.charAt(i));
            else

        Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
        int n=sc.nextInt();
        if(n%2==0 && n%13==0)
            System.out.println("True");
        else
