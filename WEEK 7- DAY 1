Q1
Dr. Max has conducted the academic task in his class with 5 Multiple Choice Questions each having 4 options A/B/C/D. 
He wanted to write a program which can evaluate the test papers of all the N students such that each correct answer is awarded 1 mark and for incorrect answer 
penalty is 0.25 marks.
The program must read the number of students N and the the answers of all the N students in the form of a String. 
If any question is not attempted by any student, then X should be given as input corresponding to that question e.g. ABAXD
It is expected that the marks of all the N students are displayed separated by SPACE.

Input Format--->First Line of the input reads the String of CORRECT ANSWERS
Second Line of the input reads the number of students N
Next N lines read the answer Strings of the N students respectively.
Constraints
N > 0
Input characters can be either in Upper Case or Lower Case
Else "Incorrect Input"

Output Format--->Print the marks of all the N students separated by SPACE

Q2
Chacha Chaudhary has asked Sheena to find out the Nth occurence of any Word in the Paragraph. Sheena finds it a tedious task to find Nth occurence so she wants you 
to write a small java program which can solve her problem and she will give you a gift for helping her. Let us write a code.

Input Format
First line reads the paragraph contents
Second line reads the word to be found and N separated by Space

Constraints
N>0 Else "Incorrect Input"

Output Format
Prints the starting index of the Nth occurence of the word in the paragraph
Prints Not Present if not occuring even a single time and prints the last occurence if occuring less than N times.

SOLUTION

import java.io.*;
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    public static int findOcc(String para, String w, int n) {
    int cnt = 0;
    int indx = -1;
    int indx2 = 0;
    while (cnt < n) {
        indx2=indx;
        indx = para.indexOf(w, indx + 1);
        cnt++;
    }
        if(indx==indx2){
            return indx2;
        }
    return indx;
}

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        /* Enter your code here. Read input from STDIN. Print output to STDOUT. Your class should be named Solution. */
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        String s = sc.nextLine();
        String w = sc.next();
        int n = sc.nextInt();
        if(n>0){
        int occ = findOcc(s,w,n);
        if(occ<0){
            System.out.println("Not Present");
        }
        else
        System.out.println(occ);
        }
        else{
            System.out.print("Incorrect Input");
}
}
}
